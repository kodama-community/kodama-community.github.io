- $\obsidian$ looks great and has a rich ecosystem of community plugins, but Iâ€™d really prefer if it could:
  - Not break the rendering of normal $\katex$ formulas I write.
  - Support drawing non-rectangular commutative diagrams.
  - Provide theorem environments or something similar.
  - Be lightweight --- my disk space is running dangerously low from all the [Electron][electron]-based apps I've already installed.
  - Work well on mobile devices with the help of a terminal emulator like [Termux][termux].

- $\forester$ looks great, but ...
  - I'd prefer to write in [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/) and $\typst$.
  - I want an [out-of-the-box][ootb] dark theme, and vector graphics rendered by the application should also have their colors properly adjusted.
  - I'd like a table of contents that's always available, even on small-screen devices.

- $\gerby$ looks great, but ...
  - I don't intend to write in $\latex$.  
  - I can't fully accept [the tag system][tags].
