$\gdef\kodama{\href{https://kodama-community.github.io/}{\includegraphics[height=0.7em, totalheight=0.7em, width=0.755em, alt=logo]{/assets/kodama.svg} ~ \color{fe7f7e}\text{Kodama}}}$

Not yet. Although $\kodama$ already has quite a few features and some early adopters, it's still in a very early stage, and breaking changes may be introduced with every release. That said, this could also be a good thing --- it means many design decisions haven't been finalized, so anyone can share ideas and actively contribute to shaping $\kodama$'s design.
